# Bryant's GitHub Page
My name is Bryant Shao! I'm a junior at UCSD studying Bioinformatics, and I'm mainly interested in Application Development.

My favorite programming langauge is **Python**, because its readable, English-like syntax makes learning new things much more streamlined.

A quote I really liked from a recent movie I watched was Klaus' signature quote from the movie *Klaus*:

> "A true act of good will always sparks another"

### My Goals for 2021 are:
- To continue to adopt new tools into my skillset
  - Both front-end and back-end tools and languages 
- To maintain good physical, mental, and social health
- Develop my specific interests within the field of software engineering
